# Titanic-Data-Science-Model-
#### Final approach at Kaggle's "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition using python
#### During this competition I applied the knowledge I've learned through various sources including university projects and independent study
#### The datasets from the project are 'train.csv' and 'test.csv' (which were given by Kaggle.com)
#### The information contained in these give you information about each passenger such as:
- Survival
- Passenger class
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (number of siblings or spouse aboard)
- Parch (number of parents or children aboard)
- Ticket number
- Fare paid
- Cabin number
- Port of embarkation
#### The idea of the proyect is to be able to predict whether some passengers aboard the titanic survived or not based on their features
#### The libraries I used vary from pandas to sklearn and seaborn
#### There are two main models which I decided to be part of this project:
- My fourth model in which I used some statistical analysis oriented towards multiple logistic regression (Toy 4.ipynb)
- My fifth model which was a little bit more oriented towards other machine learning algorithms such as Kernel Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest neighbors, and Random Forest (Titanic_Model_v5.ipynb)
#### This proyect takes part of my journey towards learning data science (which I am passionate for). 
#### There are a lot of aspects I need to become better at but I hope this will help others who want to start their data science journeys
#### Feel free to leave any suggestions (I'd love to get feedback on my overall analysis to improve future models) at sebastiangonzalezarango98@gmail.com
#### Pretty much all of the information contained in this proyect can be checked up in the notebooks
